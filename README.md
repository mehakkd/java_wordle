## Running your Project

Note that the Codio menu now provides two modes of running your project:

- First "Compile" to update the code generated by your program.

- Then use the "Run Game" menu. This will start your application.

- To view the running application, in the menu bar to the right of the
  previous item, select View Game. Assuming that a program is running, it will
  show the running application in a new window or tab.
